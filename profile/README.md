## About us :sunglasses:

This Community created for storing Project from the student and the member of the CWB Community. And also for storing tips and tricks to study and learn about technology and developments. There's also some standard, how to, and rules to help the members understand using the technology.

**We recommend looking through the pinned repositories and some list below which showcase the projects have been created and under progress.**

## Rule Standard & Tools

- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/html) - The building block of the web. No website can survive without this.
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/css) - The styling language for the web.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Track the history of my projects. It allows me to break things with no worries.
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS pre-processor. It helps me organize my stylesheets while still compiling them into a single CSS file.
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - Design tool. I use Figma when I am working with a design file. Of course, I am not a designer.
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript) - Programming language for the web browsers.
- [Powershell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/) - I use this to work with Git and to install NPM packages.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Code editor. I love this tool. It has everything that I need to write code.
